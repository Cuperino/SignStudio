SignStudio
=========

Avatar animation software made to mimic and describe the motions of various sign languages. Animations are described in relation to body parts and surrounding space, making it easier to reuse them across avatars with different physiognomy.

SignStudio is in early stages of development and is not considered usable. If you'd like to collaborate, please reach out to me on the [Cuperino Apps Forum](https://forum.cuperino.com), or to the e-mail that's publicly available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Cuperino/).

SignStudio is a part of Javier Cordero's [SignVision Project](http://signvision.org).
